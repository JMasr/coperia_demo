# coperia_demo
This repository showcases some results of the [COPERIA project](https://coperia.es/).The project is developed by the [Multimedia Technologies Group](https://gtm.uvigo.es/en/) at the **atlanTTic Research Center, Universidade de Vigo**, in collaboration with [Bahia Software](https://bahiasoftware.es/home) and the [Galcian Health Service (SERGAS)](https://www.sergas.es/).

## About

To address the significant impact of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) on global health, the [COPERIA project](https://coperia.es/) has been initiated in collaboration with the "Persistent COVID Unit of the Ourense Hospital" and primary care centers in the health area. The main objective of this project is to develop and clinically validate a comprehensive multidisciplinary platform that utilizes artificial intelligence for the diagnosis, empowerment, and clinical management of PASC patients. As part of this broader initiative, our study specifically focuses on investigating the potential of voice signal analysis as a non-invasive and accessible tool for classifying individuals as either patients with PASC or healthy individuals. The clinical study conducted in the context of the COPERIA project received ethical approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Galicia, and all procedures were conducted in compliance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their involvement in the study. The study was registered in the US Clinical Trials Registry under the code [NCT05629793].
